			<li class="question_title"><p>What is a VBAC?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>VBAC stands for vaginal birth after cesarean.</p>
				</div>
			<li class="question_title"><p>How can I use this information?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>This app will help you see the exact numbers (or rates) of VBAC in hospitals. Many care providers and hospitals claim to offer VBAC when in reality, patients are regularly discouraged from a TOLAC (trial of labor after cesarean) in their facilities.</p>
				</div>
			<li class="question_title"><p>How are the rates calculated?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>The VBAC rate is the total number of live VBAC deliveries divided by the sum of VBAC and repeat cesarean deliveries, multiplied by 100.</p>
				</div>
			<li class="question_title"><p>Where does the data come from?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>State departments of health are the only reporting agencies currently sharing VBAC data. There is no publishing schedule. It depends solely upon the department of health of each individual state.</p>
				</div>
			<li class="question_title"><p>Why is my state not included?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>This app includes all publicly available VBAC data in the U.S. If your state's data are not included, your state does not publish this information.</p>
				</div>
			<li class="question_title"><p>Is VBAC safe?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>In July 2010, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released guidelines stating that a trial of labor for following a previous cesarean section is a "safe and appropriate choice for most women who have had a prior cesarean delivery." This applies to some women who have had two previous cesareans.</p>
