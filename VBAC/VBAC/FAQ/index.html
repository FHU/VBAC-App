			<li class="question_title"><p>What is a VBAC?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>VBAC stands for vaginal birth after cesarean.</p>
				</div>
			<li class="question_title"><p>How can I use this information?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>This app will help you see the exact numbers (or rates) of VBAC in hospitals.</p>
				</div>
			<li class="question_title"><p>How are the rates calculated?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>The VBAC rate is the total number of live VBAC deliveries divided by the sum of VBAC and repeat cesarean deliveries, multiplied by 100.</p>
				</div>
			<li class="question_title"><p>Where do you get the data?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>State departments of health are the only reporting agencies currently sharing VBAC data. There is no publishing schedule. It depends solely upon the department of health of each individual state.</p>
				</div>
			<li class="question_title"><p>Why is my state not included?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>This app includes all publicly available VBAC data in the U.S. If your state's data are not included, your state does not publish this information.</p>
				</div>
			<li class="question_title"><p>Is VBAC safe?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>In July 2010, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released guidelines stating that a trial of labor following a previous cesarean section is a "safe and appropriate choice for most women who have had a prior cesarean delivery." This applies to some women who have had two previous cesareans.</p>
				</div>
			<li class="question_title"><p>What should I ask my doctor?</p></li>
				<div class="question_block">
					<p>Here are a list of questions to get you started. Most prenatal visits with a doctor last less than 10 minutes, but do not feel like any of your questions are too time-consuming or annoying.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>How many VBACs do you attend monthly?</p></li>
						<li><p>How many result in a vaginal delivery?</p></li>
						<li><p>Which local hospitals do you think are the most supportive of VBAC?</p></li>
						<li><p>Do you have any requirements of your VBAC patients (i.e., must have an epidural in labor, etc.)?</p></li>
						<li><p>Do you have any special forms I will need to fill out for your office if I am having a VBAC?</p></li>
					</ul>					
					<p>When contacting the hospital, the best chance of getting an estimate of how many VBACs occur and how many are successful is by calling the Nurse Manager of Labor and Delivery. While they may not share monthly numbers with you for privacy reasons, they would be able to indicate whether the hospital and its staff are supportive of VBAC patients.</p>
